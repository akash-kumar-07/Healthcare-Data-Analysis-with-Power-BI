  Leveraging Data for Enhanced Patient Experience ðŸš€

Healthcare data using Power BI to uncover critical insights that can drive improved patient care and operational efficiency. Here's what we found:
Average Wait Time: We identified patterns in patient wait times, highlighting peak hours where efficiency can be improved to reduce delays.
Patient Satisfaction: Our analysis of satisfaction scores revealed key factors contributing to positive experiences, providing actionable steps to elevate patient care.
Monthly Patient Visits: We tracked the ebb and flow of patient visits, helping us understand seasonal trends and better anticipate future demand.
Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments: By distinguishing between administrative and medical appointments, we pinpointed areas where administrative processes may be impacting patient satisfaction and wait times.
Referrals vs. Walk-In Patients: The balance between referred and walk-in patients was examined, revealing its effect on overall patient experience and system efficiency.
Patient Demographics: We explored patient visits across different age groups and races, offering insights into the diverse healthcare needs of our community.
These insights empower us to make data-driven decisions, ensuring our healthcare system is more efficient, patient-centered, and ready to meet the evolving needs of those we serve. ðŸ’¡ðŸ“Š
